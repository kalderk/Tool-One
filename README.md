# Tool-One
Tool 1 for Air Quality Engineering (CIVE-442)

This tool allows the user to set a number of cars passing by on the highway and see the amount of pollutants that result. The four pollutant outputs tracked are CO, VOCs, NOx, and PM, users can see the mass produced of each of these pollutants by the cars passing by per hour. The rates at which these pollutants are produced is calculated from the flowchart attached and are in per mile values (assumed speed of cars is 60 mph). These values can be applied to the mile section of highway this airshed is looking at along I-75 in Dallas, Texas.
